# incredibot-discord
This is a discord bot designed to troll one of my friends with an audio clip of him drunk singing.
Yes I know, I'm a total fucking asshole, but it's worth it. 


It operates in three modes: On command, when the user joins a chat, when the user speaks.
In on command it requires someone telling the bot to join a channel and play the noise.
In mode 2 it sits and waits for the user to join a voice channel, then joins the channel,
	plays the sound, and then leaves.
Int mode 3 it must be in a chat channel already. When the user speaks it plays the clip. 
	This is by far the most annoying and devious mode, use with caution!
